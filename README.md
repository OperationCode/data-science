# Operation Code's Data Science and Analysis Efforts

This repository was created in order to store, share, and improve the various scripts and models created for Operation Code's internal usage. The intention of this project is to encourage learning and collaboration throughout the organization's data journey.

*At no time is it acceptable to store any data in this repository. In addition, all notebooks and scripts should be cleared of any previously run analyses.*
